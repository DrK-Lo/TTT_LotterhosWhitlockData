# Simulations from Lotterhos and Whitlock 2015 and subsequent studies

The relative power of genome scans to detect local adaptation depends on sampling design and statistical method. Molecular Ecology, https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.13100

The simulations are from 90 randomly sampled populations. 10000 independent loci were simulated (9900 neutral and 100 under different strengths of selection).

These loci were analyzed by Lotterhos and Whitlock 2015 (LW2015), and subsequently by Forester et al. (ADD REF). In this respository, we organized the results from both these studies, and in some cases re-ran some of the packages that had major updates since the LW2015 study. (NEED TO ADD DETAILS ABOUT WHAT WAS RE-RUN AND UPDATED)

  * "PopID" 
  * "X_Pops" 
  * "Y_Pops" 
  * "R90" 
  * "R60"
