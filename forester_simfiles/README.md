These simulation files were created using the code from Forester et al. 2018's R code (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/17/129460). 
The code randomizes genotypes to get desired allele frequencies for populations, rather than adding SNPs sequentially.

Each simulation has a genotypes files (here in \.lfmm format) and an environment file (here in \.env format).

The R code requires the data from the Lotterhos and Whitlock 2015 (http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.mh67v) and Wagner et al. 2017 (http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.b12kk) on Dryad.
