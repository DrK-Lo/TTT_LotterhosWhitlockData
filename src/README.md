## Source Files

Write which files are Brenna's and what edits did I make.

**\*bylocus.R** scripts are edited from the scripts in Forester et al. 2018 <(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/17/129460.figures-only)>. Each method is its own script (besides rda and dbrda, which are both in the ordination_bylocus.R script). These scripts are a concatenation of Brenna's 1-Data_Prep.R script, which makes sure we are only processing the 72 simulations that were used in Forester et al. 2018, and randomizes genotypes, with the script specific to each method.
